<p>This is my first post.  I’m mostly going to be talking about programming (I like <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a>), doing programming challenges, and little sysadmin tricks I pick up along the way at work and during administration of my VirtualBox setup at home.</p>

<p>I’m a software developer at <a href="http://www.paychex.com">Paychex</a> in frigid Rochester, NY.  I work in a whole bunch of technologies, including C, Java, and .NET, on different environments.  I work mostly in the back end on our moving transmission infrastructure.</p>
