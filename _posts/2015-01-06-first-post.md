This is my first post.  I'm mostly going to be talking about programming (I like [Clojure](http://clojure.org)), and doing programming challenges.

I'm a software developer at [Paychex](http://www.paychex.com) in frigid Rochester, NY.  I work in a whole bunch of technologies, including C, Java, and .NET.  I work mostly in the back end on our money transmission and filing infrastructure.
