Hi, I'm Tom.  I'm a software developer at [Paychex](http://www.paychex.com) in Rochester, NY.

Recently I've been really into angular2 and docker stuff.

Here's a link to my [github](http://github.com/tomgeorge).

I just recently started this blog, so there's not much to it (the "about" section included).
