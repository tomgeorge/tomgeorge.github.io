Hi, I'm Tom.  I'm a consultant for [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com), specializing in OpenShift. 

Before that, I was a systems engineer for [Mobiquity](https://www.mobiquityinc.com/).  I did a lot of work provisioning AWS infrastructure and ensuring that said infrastrucutre is reliable, available, and resilient.  Comprehensive CI/CD pipelines (mostly using Jenkins ) were a close second.

Before THAT, I was a software developer for 5 and a half years at [Paychex](http://www.paychex.com) in Rochester, NY.  I did a whole bunch of stuff:  C, Java, ASP.NET, AngularJS, Angular.io, Oracle, shell, anything.  I am eternally grateful for the wide breadth of development experience Paychex gave me.  They're also a really well run company, with excellent people working there.  If you live in Rochester, you should work there.  For real.   

Currently, I live in Austin, Texas.

I **love** anything to do with Kubernetes, OpenShift, and Docker.

I'm also super into Clojure/Clojurescript.

Here's a link to my [github](http://github.com/tomgeorge).

I'm pretty bad at blogging so this doesn't get updated too much.
