Hi, I'm Tom.  I'm a systems engineer for [Mobiquity](https://www.mobiquityinc.com/).  Previously, I was a software developer for 5 and a half years at [Paychex](http://www.paychex.com) in Rochester, NY.  Currently, I live in Austin, Texas.

I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE anything to do with Kubernetes, OpenShift, and Docker.  It's just the bee's knees.  

I'm also into angular2 (or I guess it's, like, angular 5, now), Spring, and Clojure.

Here's a link to my [github](http://github.com/tomgeorge).

I just recently started this blog, so there's not much to it (the "about" section included).
